### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the "TarDocs.tar" archive to the current directory:
**tar -xvf TarDocs.tar .**
2. Command to **create** the "Javaless_Doc.tar" archive from the "TarDocs/" directory, while excluding the "TarDocs/Documents"
**sudo tar -cvvWf Javaless_Doc.tar --exclude=TarDocs/Documents/Java ~/Projects** 
3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
**tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java**
**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
**sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log**
#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
**You have to extract the files with -x from the archive before they can be created with -c. You have to create the Doc.tar with -c from the extracted files.**

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
** 00 06 3 * * * tar -czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log**
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
**mkdir ~ls /backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_use.txt
    lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
    df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
**chmod +x system.sh**   
**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
**sudo ./system.sh** 
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
 **crontab -e**
 **59 23 * * 6 sudo ./system.sh**
---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:
  **# rotate log files weekly**
  **weekly**
  **# keep 7 weeks worth of backlogs**
  **rotate 7**
  **# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones**
  **create**
  **# do not rotate empty logs*
  **notifempty**
  **# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed**
  **compress**
  **delaycompress**

    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]

  **/var/log/auth.log {**
  **missingok**
  **weekly**
  **rotate 7**
  **delaycompress**
**}**

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
  **systemctl status auditd**
2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:
  **sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf**
    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:
  **max_log_file = 35**
  **num_logs = 7**
    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:
   **sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules**

    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:
   **-w /etc/shadow -p rwa -k hashpass_audit**
   **-w /etc/passwd -p rwa -k userpass_audit**
   **-w /var/log/auth.log -p rwa -k authlog_audit**

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
  **sudo systemctl restart auditd**
5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
  **sudo auditd -l**
6. Command to produce an audit report:
  **sudo aureport -m**
7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
  **aureport -m**
8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:
  **sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron**
9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:
  **sudo auditctl -l**
---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
  **journalctl -p 0||3**
1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
  **journalctl --disk-usage**
1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:
  **sudo journalctl --vacuum-files 2**
1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
  **touch /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt**
  **journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt**
1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:
  **crontab -e**
    ```bash
  **0 4 * * * journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt**

    ```
